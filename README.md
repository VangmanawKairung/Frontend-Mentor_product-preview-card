## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass (Scss)
- CSS custom properties (Sass Variables)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Design with Media Queries
- Google Fonts
- ARIA Accessibility Features
- CSS Clamp Function

### What I learned

During this challenge, I deepened my understanding of writing clean and semantic HTML5 markup, ensuring accessibility with ARIA labels. I honed my CSS skills, particularly using Flexbox and CSS Grid to create responsive layouts, and embraced a mobile-first workflow to prioritize user experience on smaller screens. Utilizing Sass, I learned to organize my styles with variables and mixins, which improved code maintainability and reusability. I also explored using the `clamp()` function for responsive typography and integrated Google Fonts effectively. This project reinforced the importance of planning, attention to detail, and adhering to best practices in modern front-end development.

### Continued development

I aim to refine my skills in creating even more efficient and scalable code by exploring advanced CSS methodologies like BEM and improving my proficiency with Sass features such as nesting and partials. I plan to deepen my understanding of accessibility standards to ensure inclusive designs for all users. Additionally, I want to incorporate tools like PostCSS or frameworks like Tailwind CSS to streamline workflows and adapt to modern design trends. Expanding my knowledge of JavaScript for interactivity and exploring React for building more dynamic components is also a priority for future projects.
